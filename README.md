## Project: Iceberg Classifier Challenge - Machine Learning Capstone Project


### Overview

The goal of this project was to create a classifier that can successfully classify icebergs in images that were taken from satellites. The project contains these following steps:  
1. Data Analysis including data exploration, exploratory visualization, feature selection and data preprocessing.  
2. Create a Convolutional Neural Network in Keras that predicts the probability of an image containing iceberg and validate the model.  
3. Results analysis and evaluate the robustness of the model.
